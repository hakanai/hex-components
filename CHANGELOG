Version 0.3 (XXXX-XX-XX)

 Changed: Separated the components usable in other apps into a reusable library, licenced under LGPL 3.
 Changed: Zero-width annotations removed as they were causing altogether too much trouble (e.g. when sorting a list
          of annotations, it's hard to know which one is first.)  The structure DSL is updated to not drop an
          array annotation in if the length would be zero, which was the common cause for it.

(Version 0.2 didn't really exist - this project was part of Hex at the time so the changelog can be found there.)
