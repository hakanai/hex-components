BUILDING
--------

You'll need a Java build environment.  I'm developing this on Java 7 at
the moment.

You'll also need Ant.  All the other dependencies should be bundled.
If something is missing, prod me to fix it.

To build, execute 'ant' in the top directory. Files for the distribution
will appear in build/dist.
